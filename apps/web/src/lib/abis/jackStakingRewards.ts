/**
 * Hand-extracted ABI fragment for `packages/contracts/src/staking/JackStakingRewards.sol`,
 * limited to the functions this app's Stake JACK page actually calls or reads. Every name,
 * input, output, and mutability below is copied verbatim from that contract's source — nothing
 * here is invented. Regenerate in full via `pnpm contracts:build && pnpm sync:abis` once Foundry
 * is available in this environment; until then this hand-extracted fragment is exact but
 * intentionally partial (it omits owner-only admin functions this app never calls, such as
 * `pause`, `unpause`, `rescue`, and the distributor-only `notifyRewardAmount`).
